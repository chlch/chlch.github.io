### Relation terminology
#### 1. Database: set of named Relations
#### 2. Relations(Table):
 - Schema: description("metadata"), unique attribute names, atomic types
 - Instance: set of data satisfying the schema, often change

#### 3. Attribute(column, field) 
#### 4. Tuple(record, row)

### SQL language
#### 1.Two sublanguages:
 - DDL: Data definition language, define and modify schema;
 - DML: Data manipulation language, queries can be written intuitively(直观地);

#### 2.SQL DDL primary key columns
 - provide a unique "lookup key" for the relation
 - cannot have any duplicate values
 - can be made up of > 1 column


#### 3.SQL DDL Foreign key 
 - Foreign key references a table , Via the primary key of that table
 - Need not share the name of the referenced primary key

#### 4.SQL DML
``` 
select [distinct] <colunmn expression list> from <single table>
[where <predicate>]
[group by <colunmn list>]
[having <predicate>]
[order by <column list>]
[limit <integer>];

SELECT <column expression list>
FROM table_name
[INNER | NATURAL
| {LEFT |RIGHT | FULL } {OUTER}] JOIN table_name
ON <qualification_list>
WHERE …

```
#### 5.SQL 解析顺序

#### 6.Views: Named Queries
CREATE VIEW view_name AS select_statement

- Makes development simpler
- Often used for security
- Not “materialized”

### Disks and Buffers
![](dbms-layer.jpg)

- Parsing & Optimization：Parse, check, and verify the SQL and translate into an efficient relational query plan
- Relational Operators: Execute a dataflow by operating on records and files
- Files and Index Management: Organize tables and Records as groups of pages in a logical file
- Buffer Management: Provide the illusion of operating in memory
- Disk Space Management: Translate page requests into physical bytes on one or more device(s)

#### File,Page,Record format 
![](file-page-record.jpg)

#### Files: Summary
- DBMS “File” contains pages, and records within pages
- Heap files: unordered records organized with directories
- Page layouts
    - Fixed-length packed and unpacked
    - Variable length records in slotted pages, with intra-page reorg
- Variable length record format
	- Direct access to i’th field and null values
- Catalog relations store information about relations,
	- indexes and views.
