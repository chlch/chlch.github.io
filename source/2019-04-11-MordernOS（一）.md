继续开坑系列，弥补计算机基础来了。
### 1.What are the two main functions of an operating system?
providing application programmers (and application programs, naturally) a clean abstract set of resources instead of the messy hardware ones and managing these hardware resources. 
1. 为用户程序提供抽象。——将混乱复杂的硬件接口统一抽象管理方便上层程序使用。
2. 管理电脑（硬件）资源

### 2.In Section 1.4, nine different types of operating systems are described. Give a list of applications for each of these systems (one per operating systems type).

1. Mainframe OS(大型机操作系统)
The operating systems for mainframes are heavily oriented toward processing
many jobs at once, most of which need prodigious amounts of I/O.
2. Server OS
3. Multiprocessors OS
4. personal computer OS （笔记本）
5. handheld computer OS （手机）
6. Embedded OS （TV、MP3）
7. Sensor-Node OS 
8. real-time OS
9. smart card OS （Java applet）

### 3.What is the difference between timesharing and multiprogramming systems?


### 4.To use cache memory, main memory is divided into cache lines, typically 32 or 64 bytes long. An entire cache line is cached at once. What is the advantage of caching an entire line instead of a single byte or word at a time?
